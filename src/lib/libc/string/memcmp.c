/**
 * @brief Compare bytes in memory.
 * 
 * @details compares the first @p n bytes (each interpreted as unsigned char)
 *          of the object pointed to by @p s1 to the first @p n bytes of the
 *          object pointed to by @p s2.
 * 
 *          The sign of a non-zero return value is determined by the sign of
 *          the difference between the values of the first pair of bytes
 *          (both interpreted as type unsigned char) that differ in the objects
 *          being compared.
 * 
 * @returns An integer greater than, equal to or less than 0, if the object
 *          pointed to by @p s1 is greater than, equal to or less than the
 *          object pointed to by @p s2 respectively.
