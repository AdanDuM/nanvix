/* Pseudo-random generator based on Minimal Standard by
   Lewis, Goodman, and Miller in 1969.
 
   I[j+1] = a*I[j] (mod m)

   where a = 16807
         m = 2147483647

   Using Schrage's algorithm, a*I[j] (mod m) can be rewritten as:
  
     a*(I[j] mod q) - r*{I[j]/q}      if >= 0
     a*(I[j] mod q) - r*{I[j]/q} + m  otherwise

   where: {} denotes integer division 
          q = {m/a} = 127773 
          r = m (mod a) = 2836

   note that the seed value of 0 cannot be used in the calculation as
   it results in 0 itself
