/**
 * @brief Breaks a path
 * 
 * @details Parses the path pointed to by @p pathname extracting the first
 *          path-part from it. The path-part is stored in the array pointed to
 *          by @p filename.
 * 
 * @param pathname Path that shall be broken.
 * @param filename Array where the first path-part should be save.
 * 
 * @returns Upon successful completion, a pointer to the second path-part is 
 *          returned, so a new call to this function can be made to parse the
 *          remainder of the path. Upon failure, a null pointer is returned 
 *          instead.
