WHAT IS NANVIX?

	Nanvix is a Unix like operating system created by Pedro H. Penna,
	to address emerging demands of High Performance Computing
	applications. It is designed to be simple, small, modern and fully
	featured, thereby enabling cutting edge performance while
	delivering backward compatibility with existing software.  
	
WHAT HARDWARE IS REQUIRED?

	Nanvix targets multiple platforms, but the current version of the
	operating system offers full support only to 32-bit x86-based PCs.
	You can run Nanvix either in a real platform or in a virtual
	machine, using any Live System Image, available at:
	sourceforge.net/projects/nanvix/files/
