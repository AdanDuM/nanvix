WHAT IS NANVIX?

	Nanvix is a Unix like operating system written by Pedro H. Penna for 
	educational purposes. It is designed to be simple and small, but also 
	modern and fully featured.
	
WHAT HARDWARE IS REQUIRED?

	The Nanvix operating system targets 32-bit x86-based PCs and only 
	requires a floppy or CD-ROM drive and 16 MB of RAM. You can run it 
	in a real PC (or in a virtual machine) from a Live System's Image, 
	available at: sourceforge.net/projects/nanvix/files/
	
BUILDING

	In order to build Nanvix, you will need a Linux like programming 
	environment, the x86 GCC compiler and the x86 GNU binutils.
	
	Once you have setup the required tools, you should set the 
	environment variable $TARGET to point to the toolchain's directory. 
	
	When done, you can build Nanvix running the topmost makefile and 
	generate a Live System's Image running the scripts/build-img.sh 
	script.

	TIP: If you are running a Debian-based Linux distribution, like Ubuntu, 
	you can simply run the scripts/setup-toolchain.sh script.
