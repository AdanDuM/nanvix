WHAT IS NANVIX?

	Nanvix is a Unix like operating system created by Pedro H. Penna to
	address emerging manycore platforms. It targets cluster-based
	architectures that rely on a distributed and shared memory
	configuration, and it was designed from scratch to deliver cutting
	edge performance, while enabling backward compatibility with
	existing software. 
	
BUILDING AND RUNNING

	Nanvix currently supports x86-based PC platforms. You can run it
	either in a real platform or in a real machine.

	To properly build Nanvix, you need a Linux like programming
	environment, the x86 GNU C Compiler and the x86 GNU Binutils.

	If you are running a Debian-based Linux distribution, you can run
	the following commands.
