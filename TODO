Serve your self and enjoy.

======================

I. TO BE IMPLEMENTED
	
	1. Text Region Allocation
	
	    Implement xalloc(). This function shall allocate and initialize a 
	    text memory region. Indeed, some of the functionality is already 
	    implemented in sys_exec(). However, some nice features like text region
	    caching are not implemented there.

	2. File and Record Locking
	
		Implement such functionality in sys_fcntl(), It should allows process
		to access files concurrently in a safe way.
	
	3. System Calls for Dealing with Directories
	
		Implement mkdir().
		Implement rmdir().
	
	4. System Call for Creating a Special File
	
		Implement mknod().
	
	5. System Calls for Dealing with a File Systems
		
		Implement mount().
		Implement umount().
	
	6. System Call for Getting Time
	
		Implement time().		
	
	7. System Calls for Handling Messages
	
		Implement msgctl().
		Implement msgget().
		Implement msgsnd().
		Implement msgrcv().
	
	8. System Calls for Dealing with Semaphores
	
		Implement semctl().
		Implement semget().
		Implement semop().
	
	8. System Calls for Dealing with Shared Memory
		
		Implement shmctl().
		Implement shmget().
		Implement shmop().

======================

II. TO BE FIXED

	1. Race Condition on TTY Driver
	
		The input TTY queue is unprotected against race conditions. For 
		instance, it may happens that a process is reading from the device and
		suddenly the keyboard driver is fired.
	
	2. Set User ID on execve()
	
		Currently, exeve() is ignoring setuid flags.

======================

III. TO BE TESTED

	Pretty much everything =)
